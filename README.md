Just Some Cap Recipes
=====================

These have been evolving from various projects of mine... Hopefully you'll find them useful too!


Some tips
---------

* Use sample.deploy.rb as a base. Note the DEV variable...
* The nginx recipe looks for `your_app_name.nginx.conf` in your config/ directory... Checkout `sample.nginx.conf` for an example...
* The database recipe looks for different versions of database.yml too...
* The thin recipe uses sudo for `thin config`
